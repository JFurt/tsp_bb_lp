Solving the Salesman Problem through Branch and Bound and Linear Programming

## Problem description
The [salesman problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
(TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in computer science. It is widely accepted
(although not proved) that TSP cannot be solved in polynomial time by 
deterministic systems.

## Theoretical approach
This projects aims to solve TSP by combining combinatorial optimization
([Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound))
with operations research ([Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming))

## Dependencies
The LP solving is done through the GLPK library

of Parana for the Computer Sciences course.
